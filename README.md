# Sugar-Plums
Simple text adventure game in python 2, just a learning exercise.

This will be a simple text adventure game in python 2, written as an exercise.  It will have a simple combat engine, equipable weapons and armor, and an inventory system.
It needs proofreading, the code should probably be cleaned up, and several rooms still need to be written.
